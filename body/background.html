                <h3 class="text-center text-xl pt-5 indent-0">Early Exposure</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
                My first exposure to technology was from my dad, a lifelong Apple fanatic. 
                I grew up playing games like <em>Pathways into Darkness</em> on an Apple LC III in the back of my dad's hobby store. 
                From an early age, my first introduction to technology was the "other" OS as the default OS.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
                This helped shape my natual curiosity towards tech, even if it was just for entertainment. 
                It encouraged me to explore primitive systems, simple interface design and user interaction. 
                Using System 7.1 also intstilled an appreciation for alternative computer platforms.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="text-center text-xl pt-5 indent-0">Introduction to Windows</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Sometime around 2000-2001 we inherited a hand-me-down, no-name beige monster; 
                Old enough that it still had the iconic turbo-button and could only run Win95. 
                It was on this machine that I got comfortable with a command line when booting games like <em>Beholder</em> or <em>Blood and Magic</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
                These early experiences taught me how to navigate and perform tasks outside of a GUI, and that comfort of the CLI stuck.
                Even now, I prefer a terminal over a graphical interface in most instances. 
                There's something uniquely satisfying about the human-computer interaction without the obfuscation and abstraction of a polished UI.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-center text-xl pt-5 indent-0">The other "other" OS</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Fast forward to high school, which was the first time we got home internet, my laptop got borked. 
                I asked my dad how I could fix it, and he suggested Ubuntu. 
                I burned it to a DVD, and booted into the live environment. 
                Whatever the problem was, I got it fixed, but more importantly, it marked my first encounter with a UNIX-like OS after years of Mac OS. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="mt-2">
                Around this time period, I bought a first-gen Raspberry Pi and promptly sold it out of sheer intimidation. 
                I wasn't quite ready for Linux as my only OS quite yet, but the seed of intrigue was planted.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-center text-xl pt-5 indent-0">Covid Curiosity</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
                In 2020, well after high school, I was furloughed at the start of the pandemic and needed a hobby. 
                Being an eclectic person, I chose an eclectic hobby: fixing Playstation 3s.
                Around that time, the PlayStation community had just gotten ahold of the SYSCON keys; 
                this unlocked access to the internal dev tools, including system diagnostic utilities. 
                In order to leverage those tools to "talk" to the PS3, I needed a direct USB-to-UART connection.
                Naturally, I chose Ubuntu as my dev environment, because it was Free as in <em>Libre</em>, and free as in <em>price</em>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-center text-xl pt-5 indent-0">Linux: A Love Story</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Immediately, I fell in love with the environment. 
                It was intuitive; it was nerdy; it was powerful; it was Free. Linux was perfect for me. 
                Over time, Linux became my daily driver.
                I've distro-hopped, from Debian derivatives to AntiX, and eventually landed on two go-to distributions: Arch and Debian. 
                Arch for the it's rolling release schedule and a tiling window manager suited for my workflow. 
                Debian offers stability and edge-case development. 
                Since then, I've built a home lab around Ubuntu Server for ease, later migrating from bare metal to virtualized. 
                Running my own infrastructure has taught me Linux administration and Docker from scratch.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
                Hardware modifications and low-level experiments still hold my interest. 
                MagicMirrors have been a reoccurring project, built on ARM64 and x86-64 architectures. 
                If I own it, and it's modifiable, it's probably running custom firmware. 
                Sometimes I do the same for other people - free of charge of course. 
                I flashed Fresh Tomato firmware on an old router, just for the experience. 
            </p>
        
            <h3 class="text-center text-xl pt-5 indent-0">Formal Education</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
                In 2025, I transferred to Fort Hays State University as a junior to study Web and Mobile Development through their Informatics program. 
                Up until that point, everything I knew about Linux, networking and firmware had been self-taught. 
                Programming, however, I needed the structure and pressure to perform. 
                I still prefer a physical hands-on approach to learning, but formal education has helped round out and sharpen some critical skills.
